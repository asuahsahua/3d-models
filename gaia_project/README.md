# Summary

Full-box insert for Gaia Project!

The __"Most Things"__ tray holds the tech tiles that have the green marker on the back for randomization, round boosters, round bonuses, advanced tech tiles, game-end bonuses, and all the cards. The five inlay prints are meant to be put into the bottom of this tray so that the tiles are closer to the top of it. 

The __Tech Tile__ tray holds the nine tech tiles when you double up on one stack.

The __Federation Token and Gaia Planet__ tray fits into the Tech Tile tray.

You should print eight of the __Player Trays__. It is easiest if you print them with different colors, otherwise it will be difficult to figure out which color is in each. I recommend putting the faction specific pieces (Taklon Brainstone, Ivit Space Stations, Gleen Federation Token) in with that faction's pieces. The eighth player tray (green in my pictures) will hold power discs and QICs.
